// For local development, the React app development server runs on port 3000,
// and the Express app server runs on port 3001, so we've added a proxy field to
// the client app's package.json file to proxy unknown requests from the React
// app to the Express app (for local dev only â€“ only works with `npm start`).
//
// When deployed to Cloud.gov, the React app is built and served as static files
// from the Express app, so it's one app running from a single port so no proxy
// is needed for production.
